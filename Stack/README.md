# Stack Problems in Neetcode 150 Algorithm Solutions

Welcome to the 'Stack' section of the Neetcode 150 Algorithm Solutions repository. This directory is dedicated to solving algorithmic problems using the stack data structure. Here, you'll find a curated list of problems along with their solutions, focusing on the practical application of stacks in various scenarios.

## Understanding a Stack

A stack is a linear data structure operating on the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, akin to a stack of plates where only the top plate is directly accessible. Stacks are versatile and are used in numerous algorithmic solutions.

## Characteristics of a Stack

- **LIFO Principle**: The most recently added element is the first to be removed.
- **Access**: Direct access is only to the top element.
- **Primary Operations**: 
  - `Push`: Add an element to the top.
  - `Pop`: Remove and return the top element.
- **Auxiliary Operations**:
  - `Peek`: View the top element without removal.
  - `IsEmpty`: Check if the stack is empty.
  - `Size`: Get the number of elements.

## Appropriate Use Cases for a Stack

- **Undo Functionality**: Common in text editors.
- **Syntax Checking**: Used in compilers for validating parentheses or brackets.
- **String Manipulation**: For reversing or reordering characters.
- **Algorithmic Processes**: Backtracking, pathfinding, and depth-first search in graph algorithms.
