# Stack Problems

Welcome to the 'Stack' section of the Neetcode 150 Algorithm Solutions repository. This directory focuses on problems that are best solved using the stack data structure. Below, you'll find an overview of what a stack is, its characteristics, common operations, and when to use it in problem-solving.

## What is a Stack?

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. The last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. This structure is analogous to a stack of plates; you can only take the top plate off the stack, and you can only add a new plate to the top of the stack.

## Characteristics of a Stack

- **LIFO Principle:** The last element inserted is the first to be removed.
- **Access:** Limited to the top element. You cannot access the middle or bottom elements directly.
- **Operations:** The primary operations are `push` (add an element) and `pop` (remove and return the top element).
- **Peek:** A supporting operation that returns the value of the top element without removing it.

## Common Operations

- `Push`: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- `Pop`: Remove and return the top element of the stack.
- `Peek`: Return the top element without removing it from the stack.
- `IsEmpty`: Check if the stack is empty.
- `Size`: Return the number of elements in the stack.

## When to Use a Stack

- **Undo Mechanisms:** Like in text editors where you can undo the last set of changes.
- **Balancing Symbols:** Such as in compilers for checking balanced parentheses, brackets, etc.
- **String Reversal:** Using stack for reversing characters in a string.
- **Backtracking:** In scenarios like pathfinding, parsing, and more.
- **Depth-First Search:** In graph algorithms, stacks can be used for DFS implementation.
