# Neetcode 150 Algorithm Solutions

Welcome to my repository where I am taking on the challenge of solving all 150 algorithm problems listed on Neetcode.io. This project is a journey through various types of algorithmic challenges, and my primary goal is to deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures. I'll be categorizing solutions based on the type of problem, such as stack, two pointers, dynamic programming, etc., to make it easier to navigate and learn.

## Structure of the Repository

This repository is organized by problem categories, each within its own directory. Within these directories, you will find the problem solutions related to that category. Here's the structure:

- `Arrays & Hashing/`
- `Stack/`
- `Two Pointers/`
- `Dynamic Programming/`
- `...and so on for each category`

In each category folder, problems are organized with a consistent naming convention:

- A Solutions folder with each problem's solution named as `Problem_Name.py`
- A README.md file in each category folder for a general explanation on the given category.

## Problem List

The problems are sourced from LeetCode and organized as per their categorization on Neetcode.io. Hereâ€™s a glimpse of the categories and problems:
