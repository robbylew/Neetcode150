# Neetcode 150 Algorithm Solutions

Welcome to my repository where I am taking on the challenge of solving all 150 algorithm problems listed on Neetcode.io. This project is a journey through various types of algorithmic challenges, and my primary goal is to deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures. I'll be categorizing solutions based on the type of problem, such as stack, two pointers, dynamic programming, etc., to make it easier to navigate and learn.

## Structure of the Repository

Each category of problems is placed in its own directory. Inside each directory, you'll find the problems related to that category. Here's the structure:

- `stack/`
- `two_pointers/`
- `dynamic_programming/`
- `...and so on for each category`

In each category folder, problems are organized with a consistent naming convention:

- `Problem_Name.py`
- Optionally, a README.md file in each problem folder for detailed explanations.

## Problem List

The problems are sourced from LeetCode and organized as per their categorization on Neetcode.io. Hereâ€™s a glimpse of the categories and problems:

- **Stack**
  - Problem 1
  - Problem 2
  - ...
- **Two Pointers**
  - Problem 1
  - Problem 2
  - ...
- **[Other Categories]**
  - ...

For a complete list of problems, refer to the `problems_list.md` file.

## How to Use This Repository
