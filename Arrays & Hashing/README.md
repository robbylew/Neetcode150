# Arrays & Hashing Problems in Neetcode 150 Algorithm Solutions

Welcome to the 'Arrays & Hashing' section of the Neetcode 150 Algorithm Solutions repository. This directory focuses on solving algorithmic problems using array manipulation and hashing techniques. You'll find a curated list of problems that demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of arrays and hashing in various algorithmic challenges.

## Understanding Arrays and Hashing

Arrays are fundamental data structures consisting of a collection of elements, identifiable by index or key. Hashing, on the other hand, involves mapping data of various types to a fixed-size sequence, enhancing the speed of data retrieval.

## Characteristics of Arrays and Hashing

- **Direct Index Access**: Arrays allow for O(1) access time for elements if the index is known.
- **Efficiency**: Hashing provides efficient data retrieval, typically in O(1) time.
- **Applications in Problem Solving**:
  - Efficient data storage and retrieval.
  - Identification of unique or duplicate elements.
  - Grouping and sorting data based on specific criteria.

## Appropriate Use Cases for Arrays and Hashing

- **Data Lookup**: Rapid access and retrieval of data.
- **Frequency Counting**: Identifying the frequency of elements in a dataset.
- **Data Grouping**: Categorizing data into groups based on certain characteristics.
- **Order and Sequence Operations**: Operations that require maintaining the order or sequence of elements.
